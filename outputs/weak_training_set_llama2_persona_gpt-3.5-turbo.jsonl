These harnesses be designed for comfort and support, with a wider waistband and more padding in the leg and hip areas.\n4.

These harnesses be lightweight and have a minimalist design, with a focus on comfort and flexibility.\n5. Ice climbin' harness: This type o' harness is used for ice climbin', where the climber uses crampons and ice axes to ascend. These harnesses be designed for durability and have a more rugged construction to withstand the rigors o' climbin' on ice.\n6.
