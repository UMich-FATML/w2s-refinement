The most common blend of enriched air used by recreational divers is Nitrox 32, which contains 32% oxygen compared to the 21% found in regular air.\n\nDivers choose to dive with enriched air for a few reasons. Firstly, breathing enriched air can extend their no-decompression limits, allowing them to stay underwater for longer periods of time compared to diving with regular air. This can be beneficial for divers who want to spend more time exploring a dive site without needing to make lengthy decompression stops.\n\nAdditionally, diving with enriched air can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, as the higher oxygen content can decrease the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the body during a dive. This can be particularly advantageous for divers conducting multiple dives in a day or diving in repetitive days.\n\nOverall, diving with enriched air can provide divers with longer bottom times, shorter surface intervals, and potentially reduce the risk of decompression sickness, making it a popular choice for many recreational divers. So, if ye be lookin' to spend more time beneath the waves and less time waitin' on the surface, enriched air be the treasure ye seek!"}]}
