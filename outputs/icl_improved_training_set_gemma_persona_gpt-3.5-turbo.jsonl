The most common Nitrox mixtures used in recreational diving are Nitrox 32 (32% oxygen) and Nitrox 36 (36% oxygen), compared to the standard 21% oxygen content in regular air.\n\nDivers choose to dive with enriched air for several reasons:\n1. **Extended Bottom Time**: Enriched air allows divers to extend their no-decompression limits compared to diving on regular air. This means they can stay underwater for longer periods at certain depths without increasing their risk of decompression sickness.\n   \n2. **Reduced Nitrogen Uptake**: By reducing the percentage of nitrogen in the breathing gas, divers can decrease their body's nitrogen uptake during a dive. This can potentially reduce the risk of decompression sickness and allow for shorter surface intervals between dives.\n   \n3. **Shorter Surface Intervals**: Diving with enriched air can allow for shorter surface intervals between repetitive dives, as the reduced nitrogen uptake means less nitrogen needs to be off-gassed before the next dive.\n   \n4. **Reduced Fatigue**: Some divers report feeling less fatigued after diving with enriched air compared to diving on regular air, as the higher oxygen content can have a refreshing effect.\n\nIt's important for divers to undergo specialized training to dive with enriched air, as there are specific considerations and procedures to follow when using Nitrox to ensure safe diving practices."}]}
